Mr. Zoghbi paper "Fast algorithms for generating integer partitions - International journal for computing math, vol 70, pp 319-332" describes 2 fast algorithms ZS1 and ZS2 in standard representation anti-lexicographic and lexicographic order. It was seen by many professionals that algorithm ZS1 is the state of the art.
My paper "Algorithm Z1 Accelerated and Parallel Generation of Integer Partitions in Standard Form" introduces Z1, Z2 as accelerations to ZS1, ZS2.
