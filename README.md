My paper "Fast algorithms for generating integer partitions - International journal for computing math, vol 70, pp 319-332" describes 2 fast algorithms ZS1 and ZS2 in standard representation anti-lexicographic and lexicographic order. It was seen by many professionals that algorithm ZS1 is the state of the art.
My paper "Fast algorithms AZ1 AZ2 AZ3" introduces AZ1, AZ2 as accelerations to ZS1, ZS2. AZ3 is a restricted algorithm using ZS1 as a base.
